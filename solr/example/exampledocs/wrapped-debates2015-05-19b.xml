	I should remind hon. Members that until they take the Oath or affirm, they must not sit during any debate or vote in any Division of the House, and will not receive any salary.
	The arrangements for swearing in are set out in the Chamber information sheet, and a guidance note is also available from the Table and Vote Offices.
	I propose to call first the Father of the House, the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman), then members of the Cabinet, then members of the shadow Cabinet, then all Privy Counsellors not included in those two groups, wherever they may be sitting, and then other Ministers. Thereafter, I shall call other hon. Members according to the Parliament of their first entry, or, for those with broken service, that of most recent entry. The first batch will be those elected in or prior to the 2001-05 Parliament. Thereafter I shall proceed to call Members by successive Parliaments. Realistically, I do not expect to call new Members until tomorrow.
	I propose to remain in the Chair until 5 pm today, and then to return at 5.30 pm and continue until 7 pm if necessary. The House will sit again tomorrow at 11.30 am, on Thursday at 9.30 am, and on Tuesday at 2.30 pm. Tomorrow I propose to be in the Chair for swearing in until 1.30 pm, on Thursday until 11.30 am, and on Tuesday until 3.30 pm. I hope that by next Tuesday afternoon we will have made sufficient progress to enable all Members to swear in who wish to do so. I hope that Members will come forward in an orderly manner.
	I remind Members that the swearing in, as a proceeding of the House, is recorded by the television cameras, and that anything said or done by Members may appear on television or be picked up by microphones. It will assist the broadcasters if new Members state their name and constituency when they come to the Dispatch Box. Progress will depend, of course, on the number of Members wishing to swear in at any particular time. I advise Members to watch the Annunciators to establish progress, and to speak to their Whips.
